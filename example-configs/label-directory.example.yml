# Label Directory - EXAMPLE ONLY Do not use
# ==============================================================================
#
# This should already be installed in your repo at 
# `github-actions/workflow-configs/_data/label-directory.yml`. If this file is 
# already installed, continue editing your existing `label-directory.yml` file.
# 
# This file maps label "keys" (left) used internally by the workflow to the 
# actual label names "values" used in your GitHub repository (right side):
#
#   labelKey: "Actual Label Name in GitHub"
#
# Do not edit the label keys. Do, however, edit the label names to match the 
# labels you are using in your project, especially any required labels noted  
# in the `add-update-label-config.yml` file.
#
# When you implement additional workflows in the future, continue editing this 
# same file for any additional labels noted in those workflows.
#
# ==============================================================================
# How to customize this file
# ==============================================================================

# 1. DO NOT CHANGE the label "keys" on the left side - these are used internally
#    by the workflow code
# 
# 2. You can change the label name "values" on the right to match your project's 
#    naming conventions. Make sure label names are an exact match to your repo's 
#    labels (including capitalization and spacing).
# 
# 3. If you add new label "keys" to your config file, add them here too
#
# 4. Make sure label names exist in your GitHub repository before running the workflow
#
# 5. If you do not edit the name values, or if you do not include this label-directory,
#    the automation will substitute default values.
