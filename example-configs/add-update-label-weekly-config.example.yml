# Configuration for "Add Update Label Weekly" action
# This file installed at: `github-actions/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`
#
# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# ==============================================================================
#
#   1. The configuration options are given as "key: value" pairs.
#       a. Do not edit any "keys" as this may break the automation.
#       b. Customize the "values" below for your project's needs.
#   2. The default values will apply if not edited.
#   3. Text values must match the EXACT text used in your project repo.
#



# ==============================================================================
# Time thresholds (in days)
# ==============================================================================
timeframes:
  # Note: the next 3 values must be sorted min to max, recentlyUpdated < needsUpdating < isInactive
  recentlyUpdatedByDays: 3    # Issues updated within this many days are considered current
  needsUpdatingByDays: 7      # Issues not updated for this many days are prompted for update
  isInactiveByDays: 14        # Issues not updated for this many days are marked as inactive

  upperLimitDays: 35   # See explanation following and "Bot configuration" below
  # To reduce issue clutter, this workflow includes a GraphQL mutation that iterates 
  # through and minimizes previous bot comments. To avoid GitHub's rate limiting 
  # on GraphQL mutations, bot comments older than the `upperLimitDays` are not 
  # minimized. A low value results in no bot comments minimized, and a high value 
  # results in all bot comments minimized.



# ==============================================================================
# Project Board status-column configuration
# ==============================================================================
projectBoard:
  # The values in this section must match your EXACT Project Board status-column.

  targetStatus: "In progress (actively working)"   # Status-column to include.
  # Only issues status-column are included in the automation to check whether
  # assignees are updating their issues. 

  questionsStatus: "Questions / In Review"         # Used with the message template.
  # The bot's message instructs issue assignees needing help to move their issue to
  # this status-column. Issues in this status-column are NOT checked by the automation.



# ==============================================================================
# Label Directory Filepath- Do not change
# ==============================================================================

# The automation reviews which labels have been applied to the included issues, to:
#   1. Flag issues that need updates from the assignee, and
#   2. Ignore issues that do not need to be checked.
#
# The workflow relies on the label "keys" to identify the purpose of each label 
# which correspond to the actual label name "values" used by your repo.
#
#   NOTE: Since different workflows use many of the same label names, label name 
#   values are mapped in your project's label directory yml file- not here.
#   The path to your label directory is here (do not change):

labelDirectoryPath: "github-actions/workflow-configs/_data/label-directory.json" 



# ==============================================================================
# Label keys used by this workflow
# ==============================================================================

# The label "keys" shown here are used internally by the workflow.

labels:
  required:
    # Required label keys: DO NOT REMOVE, confirm "values" in  `label-directory.json`
      # The following label "keys" must be mapped to your project's actual label name 
      # "values" via the `label-directory.json` file. The workflow uses these labels 
      # to flag which issues need updates.
    - statusUpdated                # Map in the `label-directory.json` file
    - statusInactive1              # Map in the `label-directory.json` file
    - statusInactive2              # Map in the `label-directory.json` file

    # Secondary key, used by message template
    - statusHelpWanted             # Map in the `label-directory.json` file

  ignored:
    # Issues with these labels are ignored by the automation.
      # You may add or remove label "keys" from this list as desired- but be sure
      # to map the added "key" to a "value" pair in your label-directory.json file.
    - draft                        # Map in the `label-directory.json` file
    - er                           # Map in the `label-directory.json` file
    - epic                         # Map in the `label-directory.json` file
    - dependency                   # Map in the `label-directory.json` file
    - complexity0                  # Map in the `label-directory.json` file



# ==============================================================================
# Bot configuration- If needed
# ==============================================================================
# Relevant to "timeframes.upperLimitDays" setting above: Bot usernames whose 
# comments should be minimized when they become outdated. Comments are minimized 
# if they're between 'needsUpdatingByDays' and 'upperLimitDays' old
bots:
  - "github-actions[bot]"
  - "HackforLABot"
  # Only if needed, add any additional bot usernames here



# ==============================================================================
# Bot comment template - Do not change
# ==============================================================================
# Template for the comment posted to issues needing updates
# Variables used by template:

# You can use Markdown formatting to edit the template found at:

botCommentTemplatePath: "github-actions/workflow-configs/templates/add-update-instructions-template.md" # Do not change
