# Configuration for "Add Update Label Weekly" action
# Copy this file to your project: `.github/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`
#
# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# ==============================================================================
#
#   1. The configuration options are given as "key: value" pairs.
#       a. Do not edit any "keys" as this may break the automation.
#       b. Customize the "values" below for your project's needs.
#   2. The default values will apply if not edited.
#   3. Text values must match the EXACT text used in your project repo.
#



# ==============================================================================
# Time thresholds (in days)
# ==============================================================================
timeframes:

  updatedByDays: 3     # Issues updated within this many days are considered current
  commentByDays: 7     # Issues not updated for this many days are prompted for update
  inactiveByDays: 14   # Issues not updated for this many days are marked as inactive

  upperLimitDays: 35   # See explanation following and "Bot configuration" below
  # To reduce issue clutter, this workflow includes a GraphQL mutation that iterates 
  # through and minimizes previous bot comments. To avoid GitHub's rate limiting 
  # on GraphQL mutations, bot comments older than the `upperLimitDays` are not 
  # minimized. A low value results in no bot comments minimized, and a high value 
  # results in all bot comments minimized.



# ==============================================================================
# Project Board status-column configuration
# ==============================================================================
projectBoard:
  # The values in this section must match your EXACT Project Board status-column.

  targetStatus: "In progress (actively working)"   # Status-column to include.
  # Only issues status-column are included in the automation to check whether
  # assignees are updating their issues. 

  questionsStatus: "Questions / In Review"         # Used with the message template.
  # The bot's message instructs issue assignees needing help to move their issue to
  # this status-column. Issues in this status-column are NOT checked by the automation.



# ==============================================================================
# Label Directory
# ==============================================================================

# The automation reviews which labels have been applied to the included issues, to:
#   1. Flag issues that need updates from the assignee, and
#   2. Ignore issues that do not need to be checked.
#
# The workflow relies on the label "keys" to identify the purpose of each label 
# which correspond to the actual label name "values" used by your repo.
#
#   NOTE: Since different workflows use many of the same label names, label name 
#   values are mapped in your project's label directory yml file- not here.
#   The path to your label directory is:

labelDirectoryPath: ".github/workflow-configs/label-directory.yml"   # Do not change



# ==============================================================================
# Label keys used by this workflow
# ==============================================================================

# The label "keys" shown here are used internally by the workflow.

labels:
  required:
    # Required label keys: DO NOT REMOVE, confirm "values" in the label-directory
      # The following label "keys" must be mapped to your project's actual label names 
      # "values" via the `label-directory.yml` file. The workflow using these labels 
      # to flag which issues need updates.
    - statusUpdated                # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file
    - statusInactive1              # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file
    - statusInactive2              # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file

    # Secondary key, used by message template
    - statusHelpWanted             # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file

  ignored:
    # Issues with these labels are ignored by the automation.
      # You may add or remove label "keys" to this list as desired- but be sure
      # to map the added "key: value" pair in your label-directory.yml file.
    - draft                        # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file
    - er                           # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file
    - epic                         # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file
    - dependency                   # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file
    - complexity0                  # Map in the `label-directory.yml` file



# ==============================================================================
# Bot configuration- If needed
# ==============================================================================
# Relevant to "timeframes.upperLimitDays" setting above.
# Bot usernames whose comments should be minimized when they become outdated.
# Comments are minimized if they're between 'commentByDays' and 'upperLimitDays' old
bots:
  - "github-actions[bot]"
  - "HackforLABot"
  # Only if needed, add any additional bot usernames here



# ==============================================================================
# Bot comment template
# ==============================================================================
# Template for the comment posted to issues needing updates
# Variables used by template:
#   ${assignees}          - @-mentions of all assignees (e.g., "@user1, @user2")
#   ${label}              - The label being applied (e.g., "Status: To Update")
#   ${statusUpdated}      - The "updated" label name from your label directory
#   ${statusHelpWanted}   - The "help wanted" label name from your label directory
#   ${questionsStatus}    - The "questions" status on your Project Board (e.g., "Questions / In Review")
#   ${teamSlackChannel}   - The name of your team's Slack Channel
#   ${cutoffTime}         - The formatted timestamp of the issue's last update
#
# You can use Markdown formatting to edit the template found at:

botCommentTemplatePath: ".github/workflow-configs/templates/add-update-instructions-template.md"   # Do not change

# commentTemplate: |
#   Hello ${assignees}!
  
#   Please add an update comment using the below template (even if you have a pull request). Afterwards, remove 
#   the `${label}` label and add the `${statusUpdated}` label.

#   1. Progress: "What is the current status of your issue? What have you completed and what is left to do?"
#   2. Blockers: "Explain any difficulties or errors encountered."
#   3. Availability: "How much time will you have this week to work on this issue?"
#   4. ETA: "When do you expect this issue to be completed?"
#   5. Pictures (optional): "Add any pictures of the visual changes made to the site so far."

#   If you need help, be sure to either: 1) place your issue in the "${questionsStatus}" status column of the 
#   Project Board and ask for help at your next meeting; 2) put a `${statusHelpWanted}` label on your issue 
#   and pull request; or 3) put up a request for assistance on the team's <teamSlackChannel> Slack channel.

#   Please note that including your questions in the issue comments- along with screenshots, if applicable- 
#   will help us to help you. [Here](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/1619#issuecomment-897315561) and [here](https://github.com/hackforla/website/issues/1908#issuecomment-877908152) are examples of well-formed questions.
