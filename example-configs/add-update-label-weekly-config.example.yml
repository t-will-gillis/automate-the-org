# "Add Update Label Weekly" workflow configuration file
# File installed at: `github-actions/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`

# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# ==============================================================================
#
#   1. The configuration options are given as "key: value" pairs.
#     a. Customize the "values" below for your project's needs.
#     b. DO NOT EDIT "keys" as this may break the automation.
#     c. DO NOT CHANGE indentation, spacing, or formatting for same reason.
#   2. Text values must match the EXACT text used in your project repo.
#   3. The default values will apply if not edited, and the workflow will attempt
#      to run with those defaults. It is recommended to review and edit all values.



# ==============================================================================
# Labels and label placeholders used by this workflow
# ==============================================================================
#
# The `required` section is a list of label placeholder keys, identifiers 
# used in the workflow to reference GitHub repo labels. These placeholder
# label keys are essential for the workflow to function and must be mapped to 
# the **actual label names** in your project repo. These include:
#
#   statusUpdated:      Label for issues considered current
#   statusInactive1:    Label for issues needing updates
#   statusInactive2:    Label for issues considered inactive
#   statusHelpWanted:   Label for issues where assignees need help
# 
# The `filtering` section is a list of labels that, when present on an issue, tell 
# the workflow to omit that issue from the update status checks. In other words, 
# if an issue is labeled with one of the 'filtering' labels, it will be ignored by 
# the workflow and not checked for updates.
#
# As noted, the label names shown below are default values only. Each value 
# shown **must match an existing label** in your project repo. Confirm the 
# default value or change it as needed, then to show that you have reviewed and 
# confirmed the values, **delete the comment**.

labels:
  required:
    statusUpdated: "status: updated" # <-- confirm default value
    statusInactive1: "status: to update!" # <-- confirm default value
    statusInactive2: "status: 2 weeks inactive" # <-- confirm default value
    statusHelpWanted: "status: help wanted" # <-- confirm default value

  filtering:
    - "draft" # <-- confirm default value
    - "emergent request" # <-- confirm default value
    - "epic" # <-- confirm default value
    - "dependency" # <-- confirm default value
    - "complexity: prework" # <-- confirm default value
    - "" # <-- Add a value if needed. Comment out any unused values



# ==============================================================================
# Time thresholds (in days)
# ==============================================================================
#
# The time thresholds shown are used to classify issues based on the timestamp 
# of the assignee's last update. Adjust these values to fit your project's needs.
# Note that the following values must be ordered from smallest to largest:
#
#   recentlyUpdatedByDays: Issues updated within this many days are considered current
#   needsUpdatingByDays:   Issues not updated for this many days are prompted for update
#   isInactiveByDays:      Issues not updated for this many days are marked as inactive
#
#   upperLimitDays:        Bot comments older than this not processed for minimization

timeframes:
  recentlyUpdatedByDays: 3
  needsUpdatingByDays: 7
  isInactiveByDays: 14

  upperLimitDays: 35

# To reduce issue clutter and repetition, this workflow minimizes previous bot 
# comments via a GraphQL mutation. To limit GitHub GraphQL rate usage, only bot 
# comments created between `isInactiveByDays` and `upperLimitDays` ago are 
# processed. Adjust this value to include greater or fewer comments.
#
# Refer to "Bot configuration" below to set the bot username (if needed).



# ==============================================================================
# Project Board status-column configuration
# ==============================================================================
#
# The workflow only checks issues that are in the specified `targetStatus` 
# status-column of your Project Board. The `questionsStatus` status-column 
# allows assignees to opt out of checks when they need help or review.
#
# Values must **exactly match your Project Board status-column names**.
#
#  targetStatus:    Required for inclusion in update checks
#  questionsStatus: Optional; assignees may move issues here to skip checks

projectBoard:
  targetStatus: "In progress (actively working)" # <-- confirm default value
  questionsStatus: "Questions / In Review" # <-- confirm default value




# ==============================================================================
# Bot configuration- If needed
# ==============================================================================
#
# Relevant to "timeframes.upperLimitDays" setting above, repetitive comments 
# from bots with the following usernames are processed for minimization. Only 
# if needed, this value can be updated to ensure bot comments are minimized. 

bots:
  - "github-actions[bot]"
  - "HackforLABot"



# ==============================================================================
# Bot comment template
# ==============================================================================
#
# Template for the comment posted to issues needing updates. Ref. relevant labels,
# project board status-column configuration, etc. above. See template tile:
# `github-actions/workflow-configs/templates/add-update-instructions-template.md`
#
# Variables used by template:
#   ${assignees}          - @-mentions of all assignees (e.g., "@user1, @user2")
#   ${label}              - The label being applied (e.g., "Status: To Update")
#   ${statusUpdated}      - The "updated" label name from your label directory 
#   ${statusHelpWanted}   - The "help wanted" label name from your label directory 
#   ${questionsStatus}    - The "questions" status on your Project Board (e.g., "Questions / In Review")
#   ${cutoffTime}         - The formatted timestamp of the issue's last update

teamSlackChannel: ""  # Only if needed, for example "#project-site"
