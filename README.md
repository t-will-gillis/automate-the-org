# Automate the ORG 
## Shared GitHub Actions

Centralized GitHub Actions for repository maintenance and automation across the organization.

## How to Use
### Installing an Action to a Project
To install a centralized GitHub Actions (GHA) to a project repo, follow these steps:  

- Configure both of the organizational GitHub Apps:  
  - [hfla-workflow-rollout](https://github.com/organizations/hackforla/settings/installations/92646041) gives "Automate the ORG" (source) access to the project (destination) repo during installation.  
  - [hfla-graphql-app](https://github.com/organizations/hackforla/settings/installations/92507394) gives the project (destination) repo access to scripts in "Automate the ORG" (source) during the workflow's runtime.  
  - For both, first scroll to "Repository access", then "Only select repositories", then select the corresponding project repo in the "Select repositories" dropdown.  
  - Click "Save".

- Run the **"Rollout Workflow to Project"** workflow from "Automate the ORG".

  1. From the "Automate the ORG" repo, select "Actions", then select "Rollout Workflow to Project" on the left.  
  2. On the right, click on "Run workflow" to bring up installation options.  
  3. Confirm that the `master` branch is selected.  
  4. Enter the `<project-repo>` for the "Destination repo".  
  5. Do not change the "Source repo".
  6. Select which GitHub Action you would like installed
  7. Do not change the "Branch name" or "GitHub App" name. 
  8. Keep box checked for "Dry run mode". 
  9. Click "Run workflow". If successful, the "DRY-RUN" output will be found in "Rollout to destination repo".

## Available Actions

### Add Update Label Weekly

Monitors “In Progress” issues for updates since the last run and posts reminders to assignees who haven’t provided activity.<br>[Full details →](#add-update-label-weekly-1)

### (Additional Coming Soon)

---

## Set Up
Choose your desired workflow, then follow the steps to implement it in your repo.



### Add Update Label Weekly

#### What It Does

- Scans all **open, assigned** issues with a status of "In progress (actively working)"<sup>1</sup>.
- Checks for recent comments from the issue **assignee** since the last automation run<sup>2</sup>.
- If there are no recent comments from the assignee, posts a reminder<sup>3</sup> that the assignee should: 
  - provide a brief update on their progress,
  - describe blockers and request help if needed,
  - indicate their availability for working on the issue, and
  - share an estimated time to complete the issue.
- Applies the label "statusInactive1" : `status: To Update!`<sup>4</sup> if this is the first notice.
- Applies the label "statusInactive2": `status: 2 weeks inactive`<sup>4</sup> if this is the second notice. 
- Additional features:
  - Minimizes previous, repetitive bot comments within a specified timeframe<sup>2</sup>.
  - Applies the label (default) "statusUpdated": `Status: Updated`<sup>4</sup> if an update was posted recently.
  - Removes previously applied labels when appropriate.
- Ensures ongoing communication, accountability, and support across active tasks.


These are configurable, see [Step 2: Customize Config →](#step-2-customize-config):  
<sub>&emsp; <sup>1</sup> Project Board status  
&emsp; <sup>2</sup> All time periods  
&emsp; <sup>3</sup> Reminder message  
&emsp; <sup>4</sup> All label names</sub>  

### Implementing in Your Project

### How to Manually Install- 
Don't do this unless you have a great reason!

#### Step 0: Copy and rename the three workflow files that you need for your workflow. (coming soon)

#### Step 1: Copy GitHub Actions Workflow YML 
Copy and rename the example GitHub Actions Workflow YML from `example-configs/` into your repo, then customize `.github/workflows/add-update-label-weekly.yml` for cron schedule, project repo path, and PAT. 

```bash
# Ensure target folder exists
mkdir -p .github/workflow-configs

# Copy and rename the remote file into your local repo
curl -L https://github.com/hackforla/website/raw/main/workflow-configs/example-configs/add-update-label-weekly.example.yml \
-o .github/workflows/add-update-label-weekly.yml
```
See [example-configs/add-update-label-weekly.example.yml](./example-configs/add-update-label-weekly.example.yml) for a complete example.

#### Step 2: Copy and Customize Config File
Copy and rename the example configuration file from `example-configs/` into your repo, then customize `add-update-label-weekly-config.yml` for your project's needs.

  ```bash
  # Ensure target folder exists
  mkdir -p .github/workflow-configs

  # Copy and rename the remote file into your local repo
  curl -L https://github.com/hackforla/website/raw/main/workflow-configs/example-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.example.yml \
  -o .github/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml
  ```
See [example-configs/add-update-label-config.example.yml](./example-configs/add-update-label-config.example.yml) for a complete example.
#### Step 3: Copy Label Directory 
Copy and rename the example label directory file from `example-configs/` into your repo, then customize `.github/workflow-configs/label-directory.json` to match the labels you are using in your project.


```bash
# Ensure target folder exists
mkdir -p .github/workflow-configs
```
Correlate the 'labelKey' values to the 'Label Names' that are applicable to your project in the format: 
```yml
labels:
  ...
  labelKey1: "Label Name 1"
  labelKey2: "Label Name 2'
  ...
```

If you do not include the values in the config files, the default values shown in `.github/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml` will apply. For this workflow, the default values are: 

```yml
# Required by the workflow:
labels:
  required:
    statusUpdated: "Status: Updated"
    statusInactive1: "To Update!"
    statusInactive2: "2 weeks inactive"
    statusHelpWanted: "Status: Help Wanted"

# Filtering labels, exclude issues with any of these labels: 
  filtering:
   - "Draft"
   - "ER"
   - "Epic"
   - "Dependency"
   - "Complexity: Prework"
```



#### Step 5: About Tokens and Secrets

These workflows use centrally maintained GitHub Apps to authorize and authenticate workflows, including  
`hfla-graphql-app` and `hfla-workflow-rollout`. The GitHub Apps can be configured to allow repository  
access on a project-by-project basis. Access must be granted before running the workflow locally; however,  
since the App is maintained centrally projects do not need to create tokens or secrets. 


### Action Inputs

| Input | Description |  Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `config-path` | Path to config YAML in your repo | `.github/workflow-configs/`<br>`add-update-label-weekly-config.yml` |
| `recently-updated-by-days` | Override: days for "current" threshold | From config |
| `needs-updating-by-days` | Override: days for first notice | From config |
| `is-inactive-by-days` | Override: days for second notice | From config |
| `target-status` | Override: Project Board status | From config |
| `label-status-*` | Override: label names | From config |

# Monorepo Development Notes

The following applies to the **maintenance** of the `hackforla/automate-the-org` repo only.
### Setup

```bash
git clone https://hackforla/my_github_username/hackforla/automate-the-org.git
cd automate-the-org
npm install
```

### Adding Dependencies

Since this is a composite action that runs in the GitHub Actions environment, dependencies are installed automatically in `package.json`.

### Testing

Test actions in a separate test repository before releasing next version.

### Adding a New Action

1. Create new folder: `new-action-name/`
2. Add `action.yml` and `index.js`
3. Add logic to `core/` if substantial
4. Add shared utilities to `shared/` if reusable
5. Create example config in `example-configs/`
6. Update this README

### Versioning

Make all necessary changes and commit as usual:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "what is being committed"
git push
```
_Note: as always, use `git add .` or `git add <individual file>` as appropriate_

Rebuild the `@vercel/ncc` files, then re-commit: 

```bash
npm install
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "new release build"
git push
```

Update the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/hackforla/automate-the-org/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) with the latest changes (using prefixes such as "fix: " or "feat: " -see `CHANGELOG.md`) as needed, then double-check the most recent version:

```bash
git tag
```
This should match the most recent version listed in the `CHANGELOG.md`, which should also match the latest version listed in [package.json](https://github.com/hackforla/automate-the-org/blob/master/package.json). If it doesn't, then you may need to manually correct the versions.

Now run the automatic versioning utility. This will check whether you have set an `upstream`, and ask whether the next version should be a patch, minor, or major version change per [semver](https://semver.org/) (e.g. version MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):


```bash
./auto-release.sh
```

#### Versioning adjustments
Use the following for adjustments to the version tags (but only if you understand what you are doing!) 

- To remove previously-committed versions:
  ```bash
  git tag -d <version>
  git push origin --delete <version>
  ```
  _Remember to adjust `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` also._
- If you did not set your upstream branch but pushed the version anyway, you will need to set your `upstream` to `master` branch, then:
  ```bash
  git push upstream <version>
  ```

## Shared Utilities

Located in `shared/`, these are used across multiple actions:

### resolve-configs.js (Generic Config Loader)

**Generic configuration loader** used by all actions. Handles:
- Loading YAML/JSON config files from project repos
- Merging defaults, file config, and overrides
- Deep merging of nested objects
- Config validation

Each action creates its own config loader in `core/[action-name]/config.js` that:
1. Defines action-specific defaults
2. Transforms flat action inputs to nested config structure
3. Calls the generic `resolve-configs.js`
4. Validates required fields for that action

**Example pattern for new actions:**

```javascript
// core/your-action/config.js
const resolveConfigs = require('../../shared/resolve-configs');

function loadYourActionConfig({ projectRepoPath, configPath, overrides }) {
  const defaults = {
    // Action-specific defaults
  };
  
  const nestedOverrides = {
    // Transform flat overrides to nested
  };
  
  const config = resolveConfigs({
    projectRepoPath,
    configPath,
    overrides: nestedOverrides,
    defaults,
  });
  
  // Validate required fields
  resolveConfigs.validateConfig(config, ['field1', 'nested.field2']);
  
  return config;
}
```

### find-linked-issue.js

Parses PR body to find linked issues (fixes #123, resolves #456, etc.).

### format-log-messages.js

Wraps log messages with tags via `logger.` including `[STEP]`, `[INFO]`, `[SUCCESS]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERROR]`, `[DEBUG]`.

### get-repo-labels.js

Retrieve list of all labels from repo

### hide-issue-comment.js

Minimizes comments using GraphQL mutation.

### manage-issue-labels.js

Collection of utility functions for issue labeling, including `addLabels()` and `deleteLabels()`.

### manage-issue-timeline.js

Collection of utility functions for issue timelines, including `setLocalTime()` and `getIssueTimeline()`.
