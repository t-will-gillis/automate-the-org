## Automated Workflow Setup

This PR adds the "Add Update Label Weekly" GitHub Actions workflow to your project.


### Files installed by this PR

- **Workflow file**:
  - `.github/workflows/add-update-label-weekly.yml` 
- **Configuration files**:
  - `github-actions/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`
  - `github-actions/workflow-configs/templates/add-update-instructions-template.md`

### What this workflow does

- Monitors open, assigned issues with the default status "In progress (actively working)"
- Checks for recent update comments from assignees
- Posts reminders for devs to provide issue progress updates
- Labels issues that need to be checked on

### Security

- Uses organization-managed, secure GitHub App with just-in-time token
- Starts in dry-run mode (safe testing)  
- No project-specific tokens or secrets needed

### How to use

1. **Review configurations and make changes** to the respective files attached to this PR:
    - `github-actions/workflows/add-update-label-weekly.yml` 
      - Adjust the cron schedule as needed for your project (https://crontab.cronhub.io/). 
      - Current cron is scheduled to run Fridays at 0700 UTC, every week except in July and December.
    - `github-actions/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`
      - Configure specific values where shown on the config YML, but do not edit the keys or change the formatting except as explicitly noted. 
      - The `labels` section includes lists of label key values that represent actual repo labels: 
        - The `required:` section shows label placeholder keys that are essential to the workflow. Each label key must be mapped to an actual label name used in your repo, but do not change the key itself. 
        - The `filtering:` section includes keys to labels which, when added to an issue, tell the workflow to omit the issue from the update checks. In other words, an issue that is labeled with one of the 'filtering' labels will be ignored by the workflow. Match each label key shown with an actual label name. If you do not need a value, replace it with "".
        - Preliminary label names may be shown. Confirm that all label names shown here exist in your repo or change as needed. 
      - Configure the values for `timeframes:` referring to the notes in this section.
      - Configure the `projectBoard:` column-status names. Similar to the labels section, confirm the default values shown or where needed change to match your Project Board. Do not delete or edit the keys themselves.
      - Configure any remaining values as needed. 
    - `github-actions/workflow-configs/templates/add-update-instructions-template.md`
      - We recommend keeping this version. If needed, edit using markdown syntax.

3. **Test in dry-run mode**
   - Go to Actions tab → "Add Update Label Weekly"
   - Click "Run workflow" → Keep `dry-run` = true
   - Review logs to see which issues would be flagged and whether this is what you expected.

4. **Live mode**
   - When you have set up the configurations, the automation will run at the next scheduled time.
   - You can also manually trigger with `dry-run` = false if needed.
