## Automated Workflow Setup

This PR adds the "Add Update Label Weekly" GitHub Actions workflow to your project.

### Files included

- **Workflow file**:
  - `.github/workflows/add-update-label-weekly.yml` 
- **Configuration files**:
  - `.github/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`
  - `.github/workflow-configs/label-directory.yml`
  - `.github/workflow-configs/template/add-update-instructions-template.md`

### What This Workflow Does

Monitors open, assigned issues with the default status "In progress (actively working)"
- Checks for recent update comments from assignees
- Posts friendly reminders for dev to provide issue progress updates
- Keeps issue momentum and labels issues that need to be checked on

### Security

- Uses organization-managed, secure GitHub App with just-in-time token
- Starts in dry-run mode (safe testing)  
- No project-specific secrets needed

### Configuration Required

1. **Review configurations** in the files shown, and note especially the explanations in the files themselves:
   - `.github/workflows/add-update-label-weekly.yml` 
     - Adjust cron schedule as needed for your project https://crontab.cronhub.io/
     - Update `if: github.repository == 'hackforla/repo-name'`
     - Double-check the version in `uses: hackforla/automate-the-org/add-update-label-weekly@v0`
   - `.github/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`
     - Review `timeframes:`, `projectBoard:` column-status names, and the `required:` and `ignored:` labels.
   - `.github/workflow-configs/templates/add-update-instructions-template.md`
     - Update `<teamSlackChannel>`
     - Otherwise, we recommend keeping this version but of course it can be edited as needed
   - `.github/workflow-configs/label-directory.yml`
     - Make sure that your actual label names are reflected here.
     - Do not change the label `keys`. 

3. **Test in dry-run mode**
   - Go to Actions tab → "Add Update Label Weekly"
   - Click "Run workflow" → Keep `dry-run` = true
   - Review logs to confirm which issues will be identified to see if this is what you expected.

4. **Live mode**
   - When you have set up the configurations, the automation will run at the next scheduled run time.
   - You can also manually trigger with `dry-run` = false if needed.
