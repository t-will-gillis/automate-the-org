## Automated Workflow Setup

This PR adds the "Add Update Label Weekly" GitHub Actions workflow to your project.


### Files installed by this PR

- **Workflow file**:
  - `.github/workflows/add-update-label-weekly.yml` 
- **Configuration files**:
  - `github-actions/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`
  - `github-actions/workflow-configs/templates/add-update-instructions-template.md`

### File to be installed if not done already
The following file is shared among the centralized GitHub Actions, and only needs to be<br>
installed once. If the file does not exist in the repo, it will be generated and included with<br>
the PR. It will be skipped if previously installed. 
- **Additional config file** _(unless previously installed)_:
  - `github-actions/workflow-configs/_data/label-directory.json`

### What this workflow does

Monitors open, assigned issues with the default status "In progress (actively working)"
- Checks for recent update comments from assignees
- Posts reminders for devs to provide issue progress updates
- Labels issues that need to be checked on

### Security

- Uses organization-managed, secure GitHub App with just-in-time token
- Starts in dry-run mode (safe testing)  
- No project-specific tokens or secrets needed

### Configuration required

1. **Review configurations** in the files shown, and pay attention to the explanations in the files themselves:
    - `github-actions/workflows/add-update-label-weekly.yml` 
      - Adjust cron schedule as needed for your project https://crontab.cronhub.io/ at ⓵ 
      - Update `if: github.repository == 'hackforla/repo-name'` at ⓶
      - Double-check the version in `uses: hackforla/automate-the-org/add-update-label-weekly@v1` at ⓷
    - `github-actions/workflow-configs/add-update-label-weekly-config.yml`
      - Review `timeframes:`, `projectBoard:` column-status names, and the `required:` and `ignored:` labels.
    - `github-actions/workflow-configs/templates/add-update-instructions-template.md`
      - We recommend keeping this version, but edit if needed using markdown syntax.
    - `github-actions/workflow-configs/_data/label-directory.json`
      - Make sure that your `label-directory.json` file maps `keys` to their `values`:
        - `keys` needed by the automation:
          - `statusUpdated` --> "Status: Updated" _(confirm)_
          - `statusInactive1` --> "To Update !" _(confirm)_ 
          - `statusInactive2` --> "2 Weeks Inactive" _(confirm)_
        - `key` used in the message template:
          - statusHelpWanted --> "Help Wanted"  _(confirm)_
        - `keys` which tell the automation to skip the issue: 
          - _Note: For these `keys` only, OK to add or remove as needed_
          - `draft`  --> "draft"  _(confirm)_
          - `er` --> _none found: would be "ER"_
          - `epic` --> "epic"  _(confirm)_
          - `dependency` --> "Dependency"  _(confirm)_
          - `complexity0` --> _none found: should be "Complexity: Prework"_

3. **Test in dry-run mode**
   - Go to Actions tab → "Add Update Label Weekly"
   - Click "Run workflow" → Keep `dry-run` = true
   - Review logs to see which issues would be flagged and whether this is what you expected.

4. **Live mode**
   - When you have set up the configurations, the automation will run at the next scheduled time.
   - You can also manually trigger with `dry-run` = false if needed.
