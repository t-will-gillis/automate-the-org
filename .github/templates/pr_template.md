## Automated Workflow Setup

This PR adds the {{ WORKFLOW_NAME }} GitHub Actions workflow to your project.

### What's Being Added

- **Workflow file**: {{ WORKFLOW_FILE }}
- **Configuration files**: {{ CONFIG_FILES }}

- **Documentation** (soon)
  - Complete setup instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Configuration examples

### What This Workflow Does

Monitors open, assigned issues with the default status "In progress (actively working)"
- Checks for recent update comments from assignees
- Posts friendly reminders for dev to provide issue progress updates
- Keeps issue momentum and labels issues that need to be checked on

### Security

- Uses organization-managed GitHub App (secure, JIT tokens)  
- Starts in dry-run mode (safe testing)  
- No project-specific secrets needed

### Next Steps

1. **Review configuration** in {{ WORKFLOW_FILE }}
   - Adjust cron schedule
   - Update `if: github.repository == 'hackforla/repo-name'`
   - Customize reminder messages in 
   - Set project-specific labels

2. **Test in dry-run mode**
   - Go to Actions tab → "Add Update Label Weekly"
   - Click "Run workflow" → Keep `dry-run` = true
   - Review logs to confirm which issues will be identified to see if this is what you expected.

3. **Enable live mode** (when ready)
   - Manually trigger with dry-run = false
   - Otherwise, the automation will run at the next scheduled run time
