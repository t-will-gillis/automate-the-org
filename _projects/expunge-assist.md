title: Expunge Assist
description: 'Expunge Assist is a free digital tool designed to aid Californians with arrest and conviction histories in clearing their criminal records. A personal statement is the most important proof of rehabilitation filed with an expungement petition. Our letter generator helps people write their statements to the court. The tool does not rely on AI, protects personal privacy, and does not store sensitive information. Community organizers, government agencies, and legal advocates in the clean slate and criminal justice fields are making an incredible impact. Expunge Assist aims to support that work.'
